Tests for homework 1 in OOP course.
First you should replace "Slimain.cpp" file with your "main.cpp" file and update the Cmakelists in your project accordingly.
then you have to check if the functions names are the same (mainly the setters/getters), if not, change the names in Slimain to the names
that you have, there shouldn't be that much of a difference. And you are good to go. 
/** there are 11 tests, the outputs are printed to a new file named "my_output.txt",
  you should pass all the tests and get the message  "yeppeeeeeeeee ALL tests SUCCEEDED"
  ,then diffmerge the file "my_output" to the file "expected_output", enjoy :) **/
  
  
  
  note* "getComputers" function line 354 gets a pointer to the array of computers in Class Store (getter of field computers in Store).
